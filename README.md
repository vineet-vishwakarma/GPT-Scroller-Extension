# 🧠 GPTScroller Extension

Tired of endlessly scrolling through ChatGPT conversations to revisit old responses while studying or working? This lightweight browser extension lets you easily **scroll to previous messages** and improves your overall ChatGPT experience.

## 🎯 Why I Built This

While preparing for an exam using ChatGPT, I found it really inconvenient to keep scrolling up just to read previous responses. I searched for an existing extension but couldn’t find one that solved this in a clean way — so I built my own!
